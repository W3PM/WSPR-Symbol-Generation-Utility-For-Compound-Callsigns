# WSPR-Symbols
This is a self-contained utility that, in one go, will generate a text file for use with PIC assemblers. 
The utility will generate either conventional callsign/4 digit locator or compound callsign/6 digit locator data. 
Compound callsign generation follows K1JT’s convention of a three or less letter/number combination prefix followed by a “/”. A one letter or two number suffix may be used preceded by a “/”.
